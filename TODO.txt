- the aborted/timedout/closed condition in elua_uip_appcall is called more than once for the same socket ? add logs and check
- does the telnet socket need to be buffered? might be if there are clients that send data char by char (check Windows)
- test telnet thoroughly
- clean elua_uip.c after testing:
  - remove #ifdef/#define BUILD_CON_TCP at start of file
  - uncomment #ifndef in elua_uip_log
