The LM3S9B92 GPIO configuration seems to be wrong in platform_conf.h
as NUM_PIO is defined as 7 but the pin_array has 9 entries. Also the manual
suggests that LM3S9B92 has indeed 9 ports, but it skips PI for some reason
and goes directly to PJ. The code should be modified to handle this kind of 
irregular mapping. Right now it will appear with a 0 in the pin array table.
Maybe define a "bitmask" if individual pins instead of whole ports are missing.

Add explicit pin mapping for ALL peripherals in the configuration files. And
add runtime pin mapping support in eLua based on this.
