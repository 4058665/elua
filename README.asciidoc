Mizar32 branch of eLua
======================

The Mizar32-v0.9 branch is simplemachines.it's modifications to the
eLua 0.9 release to produce their firmware release.

For the 256K and 512K models, the firmware is largely the same as
the default config from mainline eLua.

Most of the hacks here are code size reductions for the 128K model, and
to fit in 120KB, it has to be compiled using an AVR32 toolchain created by
   http://spaces.atmel.com/gf/project/ct-ng/
selecting gcc-4.4.7 and newlib-1.17 and built using:
   scons board=mizar32 cpu=AT32UC3A0128 target=lualong allocator=simple \
	 optram=0 rostrings=0
   avr32-objcopy -O ihex elua_lualong_at32uc3a0128.elf \
			 elua_lualong_at32uc3a0128.hex
as it is a very tight fit.
